🎹 Maestro AI Frontend: Project StatusThe frontend for the Maestro AI Tutor is now Feature Complete. It is designed as a high-performance, real-time dashboard that integrates live computer vision with interactive musical notation.🚀 Technical Achievements1. State Management (The Brain)We implemented Zustand to handle the application's global state. This allows for near-zero latency when updating AI detections.Centralized Store: Manages songQueue, currentChordIndex, and detections (coordinates).Simulated Testing: Includes a manual "trigger" to verify that the store can update the UI without needing the backend.2. High-Fidelity UI (The Skin)The interface uses Tailwind CSS v4 with a "Modern Studio" aesthetic.Glassmorphism: Semi-transparent panels with backdrop-blur for a premium feel.Viewport Locking: Forced h-screen (100vh) layout to ensure a professional "App" experience with zero vertical scrolling.Responsive Grid: A 12-column system that prioritizes the video feed (9 cols) while keeping the AI Teacher panel (3 cols) visible.3. AI Overlay Engine (The Vision)The VideoOverlay component uses a layered stack architecture:Layer 0 (Video): Direct stream from the user's webcam.Layer 1 (Canvas): A transparent HTML5 Canvas perfectly aligned over the video to draw YOLO detection dots at $(x, y)$ coordinates.Layer 2 (HUD): A CSS overlay showing "AI Vision Active" status.4. Interactive Music TimelineThe ChordSheet component provides a "Guitar Hero" style experience:Framer Motion: Smooth, spring-based animations for the sliding chord belt.Center Playhead: A laser-guided marker that indicates the exact moment a chord should be played.Dynamic Styling: Past chords fade out, and the "Current" chord pulses with a cyan glow.🛠 Project StructureBashsrc/

📡 Ready for IntegrationThe frontend is currently in Listener Mode. It is expecting a JSON stream of coordinates via a WebSocket/Socket.io connection. Once the Python backend emits detection_update, the UI will automatically render the AI's vision.
